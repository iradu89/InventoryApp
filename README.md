## Inventory App

This app allows a store to keep track of its inventory of products. It can store information about price, quantity, supplier and a picture of the product. It keeps track of sales and can can order from the supplier by sending an intent to an e-mail app.

In this app I learned how to:
- Store information in a SQLite database
- Integrate Android's file storage system into that database
- Present information from files and SQLite databases to users
- Update information based on user input
- Crate intents to other apps using stored information
